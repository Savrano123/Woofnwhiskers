**About Woof & Whiskers**  
*Where Love Meets Paws*  

Welcome to **Woof & Whiskers**, your neighborhood pet haven nestled in the heart of Dwarka, New Delhi! We’re not just a pet shop – we’re a family of passionate pet lovers dedicated to ensuring every furry, feathery, or scaly friend lives a happy, healthy life.  

### **Our Story**  
Hi there! I’m [Your Name], the proud (and slightly obsessive) human behind Woof & Whiskers. As a lifelong animal lover, I’ve always believed pets aren’t just companions – they’re family. When I started this journey, I wanted to create a space that reflected this belief. While I’m not a seasoned seller or a big business with employees, what I *do* have is an unwavering commitment to pets and their well-being.  

### **What We Do**  
- **Ethically Sourced Puppies & Pets**: We *gather* puppies and pets from trusted sources, shelters, and rescue networks – **never from breeders**. Our focus is on connecting loving homes with pets who need them, not profit.  
- **Health-First Products**: From nutritious food to safe toys and grooming essentials, every item in our store is handpicked with your pet’s health in mind.  
- **Supporting Shelters**: We collaborate with local shelters to donate supplies, raise awareness, and even host adoption drives. Every purchase you make helps us give back!  

### **Why Choose Us?**  
- **No Breeding, Just Love**: We stand firmly against unethical breeding practices. Our mission is to advocate for pets, not exploit them.  
- **Small Shop, Big Heart**: As a solo venture, we take pride in offering personalized care and advice. Need help choosing the right food? Just ask!  
- **Community-Driven**: Dwarka is our home, and we’re passionate about building a pet-loving community here. Follow us for tips, events, and heartwarming adoption stories.  

### **Join Our Paw-some Mission**
