How to Use the Blog Import Feature
I've created a complete solution for uploading blog posts generated by LLMs to your website. Here's how to use it:

1. Generate Blog Content with LLMs
Use your preferred LLM (like ChatGPT, Claude, etc.) to generate blog content
You can format the output in either JSON or Markdown format: JSON Format Example:
{
  "title": "10 Essential Tips for New Pet Owners",
  "excerpt": "A comprehensive guide for first-time pet parents to ensure a smooth transition.",
  "content": "<p>Bringing home a new pet is exciting, but it also comes with responsibilities...</p>",

Markdown Format Example: ```markdown
title: 10 Essential Tips for New Pet Owners excerpt: A comprehensive guide for first-time pet parents to ensure a smooth transition. category: Pet Care tags: new pets, pet care, beginners guide author: Dr. Pet Expert authorTitle: Veterinarian published: true readTime: 5
10 Essential Tips for New Pet Owners
Bringing home a new pet is exciting, but it also comes with responsibilities.
1. Prepare Your Home
Before bringing your new pet home, make sure your space is safe and comfortable.
2. Find a Veterinarian
Schedule a check-up within the first week of bringing your pet home.
Save the generated content as a .json or .md file on your computer
2. Upload the Blog Post
Log in to your admin dashboard
Navigate to the Blog section
Click the "Import Post" button (the new green button I added)
Select the JSON or Markdown file you saved
Click "Import Blog Post"
After successful import, you'll be redirected to the edit page where you can make any final adjustments
3. Review and Publish
On the edit page, review the imported content
Make any necessary adjustments
Add a cover image if needed
Ensure the "Publish post" checkbox is checked if you want to publish immediately
Click "Save Post"
